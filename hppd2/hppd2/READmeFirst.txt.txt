Notice this is the first version of this and its not perfect.
but it does do what its supposed to do. im running a NVIDIA GeForce 6800 GT on this PC
so If your using a different card it may go slower.
How to use:

When the program starts you will be at a random logo

press space to shift the color towards the logo
press enter to have it explode in haze
use the up and down arrow keys to send waves going up or down
use left, right arrow keys to change the picture

use the mouse to chase away any of the pixels in the cursors path
click on the mouse to cause a explosion
by doing combinations of these keys can create some nice effects.

This is freeware you can do whatever you choose with it , but at your own risk.
