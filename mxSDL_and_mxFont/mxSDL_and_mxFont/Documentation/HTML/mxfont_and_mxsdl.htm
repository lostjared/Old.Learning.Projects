<P><FONT face=Verdana size=2>mxFont 
&amp;&amp; mxSDL are easy to use development librarys that use SDL (<A 
href="http://libsdl.org">http://libsdl.org</A>) that incorperate OOP into SDL as 
well as windows fonts. Since SDL dosent support any font functions by default. 
(Of course there is SDL_ttf but that requires additional depdencys) all mxFont 
requires is the SDL_font.h header file if your going to use plain old SDL, or 
the mxSDL_font.h header file if your going to use my SDL wrapper as well as the 
font files created with the font editor. You can create your own fonts, or rip 
windows fonts and then use them in your SDL application or any graphical 
application for that matter all you gotta do is change the SetPixel function in 
SDL_font.h to plot a pixel for your API. Feel free to change the variable names, 
to suit your style. The Font editor contains quite a number of tools , and the 
ability to edit windows fonts and change them to suit your application. A mxf 
font file is about 249 kb for a default windows font. Not to shabby if you ask 
me. Heres a example of a SDL application displaying a mxf font. (BTW: you can 
resize and change the color of the fonts on the fly so theres no need to reload 
the data only reload the 
font if your going to change specific 
fonts.)</FONT></P>
