<P>Its easy just double click on the .sln file from windows explorer after 
extracting all the archives. Then click Rebuild All from the main menu<BR>after 
its all compiled which shouldnt take very long you can execute the 
program.<BR>it uses embedded resources and a manifest file so it will look 
pretty atleast it does in my opinion with my Alienware theme.</P><FONT face=Verdana size=2>
<P><BR><STRONG>To Compile the Examples:</STRONG><BR>First things First you need to download the SDL 
win32 Development Librarys at <A 
href="http://libsdl.org">http://libsdl.org</A>&nbsp;second you need to set up your 
VS.NET to Know where they are. Say you downloaded it to c:\SDL\SDL-1.2.9&nbsp; 
you would right click on your project, choose properties, than go to the correct 
tab with "Additional Include Directorys " (Sorry doin this off the top of my 
head since VS.NET 2003 Keeps Crashing)</P>
