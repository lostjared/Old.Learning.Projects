This is a library to use ripped windows fonts versus the actual truetype fonts..
it is its own unique file format this is the C implementation of mxf.
you can download the MXF Font Editor from http://lostsidedead.biz/projects.php?id=mxsdl
you can dynamicly scale the fonts, as well as change the color without having to reload
the font from the file system.
