This article is a explanation of the MasterX SDK. It contains a basic overview
of what it is, as well as explantions of all the objects. This can be thought of as a reference to all the examples using it. So lets get started.<br><br>
<br><br>
<b><u>Basic Information</u></b><br><br>
MasterX SDK, started along time ago when I first got into video games. The first version of I made, wasnt all that great but worked fairly well. I totaly redesigned it from scratch, using the same basic concepts, and then have updated it over time, and now I think it is pretty well evolved. I plan on only making until a 2.0 , and then a new different library will be produced. Its going to be a joint effort between  one of my friends.  <br><br>

Like the introduction screen, the game screen, and or anything screen you desire. The object contains many methods, which can be used to preform many tasks text related tasks such as printing text, switching fonts, colors, and more.
