This game  is an example using Jared Bruni'S MasterX SDK
the source is also available on www.lostsidedead.com or www.planet-source-code.com

You need DirectX 8.0 to play that game
This was not tested on previous Version.

You can use a full win/DX compatible Joystick or Gamepad.
as well as a Keyboard off course =)

The rules of the game:

#1------dont let the customers reach the end of the counter where you are (the bartender)
#2------dont throw a mug on the opposite wall (no one is there to catch it)
#3------Catch the empty beer glasses from the customers
#4------Enjoy!!!

You must knock down customers waves after waves of them.....

the difficulty is always increasing.....so you can play a while, there'S an infinity of levels !!

If you dont like to play that game without music go download the original MP3s of the Tapper game called "can-can"
and play it while you play, I was not gonna include this here ;)

Now.......less reading, more playing!!! go out there and kick those drunk's ass!
