# Old Learning Projects: A Journey Through Programming

Welcome to my collection of Old Learning Projects. This repository serves as a digital scrapbook, chronicling the various projects I undertook to master C++ throughout different stages of my life. Each project encapsulates a moment in time, reflecting the errors and experiments that paved my way through the complexities of programming.

Originally, many of these projects found their home on Planet Source Code (PSC) as I navigated my early days of coding. However, as I evolved and began crafting projects for my personal website, I decided to remove them from PSC. Now, gathered here, they stand as milestones of my learning journeyâ€”each mistake, a lesson; every line of code, a step towards growth.

These projects are more than just files; they're a testament to the learning process, showcasing the evolution of ideas and the development of skills over time. They represent the essence of self-taught proficiency, marking the trials and triumphs encountered along the path of becoming proficient in C++.
