you are free to use this for whatever, just dont steal my code and say you wrote it.
if you put this on your web site , just link to mine, and give me props for my work, thats all I ask.



Whats in this zip, there are 2 examples and they work together

#1 listens
#2 will connect

#2 will send data
#1 will recive it and display it


once you understand how to use mastersocket, you can add mastersocket.cpp
and mastersocket.h into your project (just link to wsock32.lib) and you
can do some simple winsock
