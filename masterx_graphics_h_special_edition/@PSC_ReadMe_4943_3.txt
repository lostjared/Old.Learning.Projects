Title: MasterX SDK 2.0 *Special Edition* graphics.h winbgi port
Description: This is a special version of MasterX SDK 2.0 , it contains a library I found called winbgi which I did not write, but modified to use MasterX SDK to initilize directX. It ports graphics.h programs to run under windows, in a directX fullscreen application. You can use the masterX hwnd object inside your graphics.h application ports so you can play mp3's, play sounds, and get direct input.
